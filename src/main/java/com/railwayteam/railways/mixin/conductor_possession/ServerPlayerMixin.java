/**
 * Makes sure the server does not move the player viewing a camera to the camera's position

 * Updated for 1.21.1: In 1.21.1, the tick() method calls entity.isAlive() on the camera without
 * a null check. We need to ensure the camera is never null, so instead of canceling setCamera
 * entirely, we let it proceed but intercept absMoveTo to prevent position sync.
